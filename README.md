# Kichin.NYC

For some reason, you've stumbled upon our Github repo containing the code that powers the Kichin website.

If you're curious: we used Jekyll with Foundation 5 to create our landing page. When we later expand our site to a more full-fledged online publication, we'll use Rails, possibly Wordpress.

Thanks, and enjoy!
